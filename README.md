How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting and implementing user needs is an important part of any business looking to imporve their product for the better. By going directly to end users and asking them what they would like to see out of the product and making user stories out of them, this allows the team to have a better understanding of what their goals will be. The user stories provide a template for how the product should function and allows the team to stay efficient and beteer stay on task.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I think that keeping an open mind and staying efficient are the most important qualities to keep in mind when approaching the development cycle. Being able to produce a working product that satisfies all parties should be the main priority of the group or buisness even over documentation. As for agile processes i would love to see Kanban boards be used within my teams. I think that these boards are a great oppurtunity for the team to understand what is going on and see where the team is at in the process while also allowing a source of organization for the project. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me a good team memeber is always able to communicate with all other team members no matter what. They should be able to highlight certain issues and have the clarity to point out issues they may run into or have already run into. They should always be positive and be open to constuctive feedback as well as have the ability to give feedback. They should have enough focus to keep on their part of the work and have the ability to claim responsibility for their work.
